1. **View Products**: Customers should be able to browse and view products based on different categories (e.g., Electronics, Books).
2. **Add to Cart**: Customers can add products of their choice to their shopping cart.
3. **Manage Cart**: Customers can add, delete, and modify products in their shopping cart.
4. **Place Orders**: Customers can place orders by providing essential details such as address, phone number, payment information, net billed amount, and quantities of products.
5. **View Order History**: Customers should be able to view all their past orders.

## Seller Functionalities:
1. **Add Products**: Sellers can add new products to the system for sale.
2. **Modify/Delete Products**: Sellers can modify or delete products they have previously added to the system.
