## Problem Statement - E-Commerce Web Application
The problem statement requires you to create a full-stack e-commerce web application using React for the front-end, Spring Boot for the back-end, and any RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) for data persistence.

The application will cater to three different types of users: Customers, Sellers, and Admin.

## Common Functionalities for all users:
1. **Login**: Users should be able to authenticate and log in to the application.
2. **Register/Signup**: New users should be able to create an account either as customer or seller.
3. **Update Personal Details**: Users should be able to update their personal information.

## Customer Functionalities:
1. **View Products**: Customers should be able to browse and view products based on different categories (e.g., Electronics, Books).
2. **Add to Cart**: Customers can add products of their choice to their shopping cart.
3. **Manage Cart**: Customers can add, delete, and modify products in their shopping cart.
4. **Place Orders**: Customers can place orders by providing essential details such as address, phone number, payment information, net billed amount, and quantities of products.
5. **View Order History**: Customers should be able to view all their past orders.

## Seller Functionalities:
1. **Add Products**: Sellers can add new products to the system for sale.
2. **Modify/Delete Products**: Sellers can modify or delete products they have previously added to the system.
3. **View Products**: Sellers can view all the products available in the system, similar to customers.
4. **No Ordering**: Sellers cannot place orders within the application.

## Important Instructions:
1. Use separate packages for different layers (controller, service, etc.).
2. Design the UI as per your preference, including colors, buttons, images, and icons.
3. Provide necessary error messages for validation.
4. Fetch login/logout details from the database or use third-party authentication tools like Okta.
5. Use proper APIs to perform operations.
6. Follow naming conventions in your code.
7. Choose any RDBMS for data storage (MySQL, H2, Oracle, etc.).
8. Create the necessary tables to implement the required functionalities, ensuring proper normalization and ACID properties. Provide a schema diagram of all the tables in a PDF format.
9. You can add additional functionalities such as searching, sorting, pagination, etc., to your application.

> [!NOTE]
> The instructions provide an overview of the required functionalities and 
> guidelines for implementation. You would need to dive into the specifics of 
> each functionality and design the application accordingly.
