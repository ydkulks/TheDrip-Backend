    ./gradlew bootRun # if you have gradlew or gradlew.bat file at root of the project
    ./gradlew build # for production
    ```

## üìê MVC Project Architecture
`com.domain.ProjectName/`

- **Controller** : Handle HTTP requests
- **Service**    : Business logic
- **Model**      : Entities corresponding to database tables
- **Repository** : Database interactions using JPA

## ‚õÉ Database setup(PostgreSQL)
0. **Update package repository database**

    ```sh
    sudo pacman -Syy
    ```
1. **Install PostgreSQL**

    ```sh
    sudo pacman -S postgresql
    ```
2. **Initialize database directory**

    ```sh
    sudo -iu postgres # Login as 'postgres' user
    initdb --locale $LANG -E UTF8 -D '/var/lib/postgres/data/'
    exit
    ```
3. **Start PostgreSQL server**

    ```sh
    su # Login as root user
    sudo systemctl start postgresql
    sudo systemctl status postgresql
    sudo systemctl enable postgresql
    exit
    ```
4. **GUI for PostgreSQL**

    ```sh
    yay -S pgadmin4-desktop
    ```

Open the app and create server and database before moving on with the next step.

5. **Create a user to access a database**

    ```sh
    psql -U postgres
    ```
    ```sql
    \du
    CREATE ROLE user_name WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'your_password';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE database_name TO user_name;
    ```
6. **Uninstall PostgreSQL**

    ```sh
    sudo pacman -Rcns postgresql
    ```
